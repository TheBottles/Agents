"""
The goal of this pathfinding script is to take a location on the map and
find the best way to reach it. You should take in a target location,
selected units (probably in the obs), and return an intermediate point
on the map. This file will simply implement the function produced by
a machine learning algorithm.

# Important things to note:
#   1. You may want use a class to perform these tasks
#   2. You may want to have a class load up pre-configured weights
#   3. You may want it to dynamically learn everytime it makes a decision
